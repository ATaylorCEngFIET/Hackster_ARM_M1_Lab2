PLCK-12#1 Warning
Clock Placer Checks  
Poor placement for routing between an IO pin and BUFG. 
Resolution: Poor placement of an IO pin and a BUFG has resulted in the router using a non-dedicated path between the two.  There are several things that could trigger this DRC, each of which can cause unpredictable clock insertion delays that result in poor timing.  This DRC could be caused by any of the following: (a) a clock port was placed on a pin that is not a CCIO-pin (b)the BUFG has not been placed in the same half of the device or SLR as the CCIO-pin (c) a single ended clock has been placed on the N-Side of a differential pair CCIO-pin.
 This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint is set to FALSE allowing your design to continue. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design.

	DAPLink_tri_o_IBUF[15]_inst (IBUF.O) is locked to U15
	DAPLink_tri_o_IBUF_BUFG[15]_inst (BUFG.I) is provisionally placed by clockplacer on BUFGCTRL_X0Y0

REQP-1839#19 Warning
RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 m1_for_arty_s7_i/CORTEXM1_AXI_0/inst/gb_DTCM.u_x_dtcm/genblk3[1].ram_block_reg_0_0 has an input control pin m1_for_arty_s7_i/CORTEXM1_AXI_0/inst/gb_DTCM.u_x_dtcm/genblk3[1].ram_block_reg_0_0/ADDRARDADDR[14] (net: m1_for_arty_s7_i/CORTEXM1_AXI_0/inst/gb_DTCM.u_x_dtcm/ADDRARDADDR[12]) which is driven by a register (m1_for_arty_s7_i/CORTEXM1_AXI_0/inst/u_cortexm1/u_core/u_ctrl/use_imm_ex_reg) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
